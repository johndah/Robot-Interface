# Robot-Interface
An android application to send linear and angular velocities to a simple robot, i.e. Raspberry Pi mounted with motors and wheels. 

The virtual joystick is from https://github.com/controlwear/virtual-joystick-android, which is very nicely done!

The park button is so far a dummy button, it will be updated to follow a mark with object detection applied to pictures taken by Raspberry's camera. There is some final debugging to do.
